# Introduction

Excel is ideal for quick, ad hoc analyses where analysts need to answer specific questions or explore data without the need for complex tools.
In this project, I utilised Excel for Data cleaning and preperation as well as data viusalisation. Interactive Dashboards, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Aggregation functions and statiscal analysis were used in order to generate business relevant insights from the data.

# Dashboard and Pivot Tables

This interactive dashboard users its accompanying slicers as filters, enabling viewers to filter by Roast Type, Order Size and Loyalty Program Status. Additionally, they can view the Sales by country and Top 5 customers for the filtered range in order to identify trends and better understand their consumers.

The heatmap color coding of the Total Sales pivot table helps to quickly identify high and low sales months for each coffee type, where red signifies low values and green signifies high values. 


# Summary of Insights

**Yearly Trends:**

Overall Sales Growth: Sales generally show an upward trend from 2019 to 2021 across all coffee types. There is a notable increase in total sales each year, indicating growing demand and possibly effective marketing strategies.

**Seasonal Trends:**

Holiday Seasons: Sales peaks in April, November, and December could be associated with holiday seasons like Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas when consumers might purchase more coffee for celebrations and gatherings.

**Popularity of Coffee Products:**

General Popularity: Arabica and Excelsa are consistently popular, showing strong sales across most months and years. Liberica and Robusta also perform well, but their sales are more fluctuating compared to Arabica and Excelsa.

**Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic**

Dips in May 2020: The dips in sales in May 2020 for multiple coffee types might be attributable to the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns affecting consumer behavior and supply chains.
Post-Pandemic Growth: Sales in 2021 and early 2022 indicate recovery and growth, particularly for Arabica and Excelsa. The data suggests a strong rebound in sales, with significant peaks in September 2021 for Arabica and March 2021 for Liberica.

**Loyalty Program Effectiveness**

Re-evaluating loyalty program: There are a comparable amount of transactions from members and non-members of the loyalty program. However, customers who are members spend less on average per transaction, compared to customers who are not members. This signals that the loyalty program may be in fact hindering the sales of coffee products and could use a re-evaluation, in order to better incentivise members to purchase more goods, more frequently.
